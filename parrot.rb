# Happy Parrot - This parrot is so happy. It accepts a 'thing' as its argument and then returns a string where it says how happy it is about the thing!
def happy_parrot(thing)
  "I am so happy about #{thing}!"
end

# Boring Parrot - Write a method for a boring parrot that just returns whatever string you give him as an argument.
def boring_parrot(phrase)
  "#{phrase}"
end


# Math Parrot - Create a method that accepts two numbers as arguments and adds them together!
def math_parrot(x,y)
  x+y
end


# Friendly Parrot - This parrot greets people by returning their name and age (don't forget to pass that information in as arguments).
def friendly_parrot(name,age)
  "Hello,#{name}! You are #{age} years old!"
end

# Favorites Parrot - Tell this parrot about your three favorite things and he will return "I love <that thing> too!" for each of them.

def favorites(thing)
  "I love #{thing} too!"
end

def age(age)
  "You are #{age} old? You're ancient "
end
# Now try calling your methods below with any arguments of your choice and puts them to the screen. Like this:
puts happy_parrot("waffles")
# call your methods here
puts boring_parrot("Hello!")
puts math_parrot(4,7)
puts friendly_parrot("Molly", "15")
puts favorites("cake")
puts age(78)
# Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each of the parrot's so that they speak backwards. How would you do that?




# The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them shout in all caps.
